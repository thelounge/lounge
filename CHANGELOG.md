[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v1.4.3...v1.5.0)

With this release, administrators can now define a maximum size for channel history.

Other changes noticeable by users include removing custom print styles and preventing sequences of white spaces to collapse into one.

## v1.4.2 - 2016-03-31

## v1.4.1 - 2016-03-28

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1)

As of this release, running `/query nick` will simply open a chat window with user `nick`, instead of calling `whois` for this user.

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v1.3.1...v1.4.0)
