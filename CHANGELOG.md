## v2.7.1 - 2018-02-18

For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.7.0...v2.7.1) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/milestone/29?closed=1).

This releases mainly fixes bugs that were introduced by previous versions, and comes with very minor improvements to the UI. Among other things, we fixed the unread markers showing multiple times, which in turn fixes memory leaks when keeping The Lounge open for long periods of time (e.g. overnight).

This simply ensures we did not leave any unattended bugs before going for The Lounge v3.

## v2.7.0 - 2018-01-28

For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.6.0...v2.7.0) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/milestone/27?closed=1).

The Lounge v2.7.0 is out, and it's a big one! Here is a shortlist of the most notable additions and changes, but as usual, a comprehensive list is available below.

It is now possible to join a channel directly from the UI:

<p align="center">
  <img width="187" alt="A tooltip saying Join a channel shows up when hovering the + next to a network name in the channel list" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35205922-f5662fc6-ff06-11e7-8b33-2f76354eff51.png"> <img width="192" alt="A form lets the user type a channel name, an optional password, which can then be joined by clicking the submit button" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35205923-f57147e4-ff06-11e7-942b-5bce2c2d3e78.png">
  <br>
  <em>The <kbd>+</kbd> button next to any network opens a form to join a channel.</em>
</p>

Nicks mentioned in messages are now clickable:

<p align="center">
  <img width="385" alt="A user mentions someone else's nick in a message, which is now clickable and takes the user's color" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206011-8cbc48ec-ff07-11e7-8969-8305a0501d24.png">
</p>

Context menu actions have been improved, and new actions have been added:

<p align="center">
  <img width="186" alt="Available actions in user context menu: User information, Direct messages, Kick" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206072-f29768e0-ff07-11e7-993f-10668751053e.png"> <img width="184" alt="Available actions in channel context menu: List banned users, Leave" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206073-f2a45424-ff07-11e7-897e-a94b64339bf9.png"> <img width="186" alt="Available actions in network context menu: List all channels, Join a channel, Disconnect" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206074-f2af90a0-ff07-11e7-8e19-d818c2c5579c.png">
  <br>
  <em>Available actions on nicks in the chat window, and on channels and networks in the channel list</em>
</p>

A long-awaited feature, it is now possible to add customizable strings when auto-completing nicks at the beginning of a message:

<p align="center">
  <img width="512" alt="When comma+whitespace is set in the Settings, auto-completing nicks will add a comma and a space at the beginning of the message, and a space otherwise" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206213-12a904d0-ff09-11e7-9d32-ea68693677f7.gif">
  <br>
  <em>To achieve this, set <code>, </code> in your client settings.</em>
</p>

The user information available when sending the `/whois` command (or clicking the corresponding action in a user context menu) has been enhanced:

<p align="center">
  <img width="620" alt="User information is now displayed as a definition list" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206346-09e23230-ff0a-11e7-95b7-c4826aa2f82c.png">
</p>

Message styling now supports strikethrough text, monospace font, and additional colors:

<p align="center">
  <img width="183" alt="'Hello world' in a message, where 'Hello' is striked through, and 'world' is monospace" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206448-b5c51d2e-ff0a-11e7-83d6-62375bf7a302.png">
  <br>
  <em>Strikethrough is achieved with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>. Monospace is achieved with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>.</em>
</p>

The Help window gains a version checker, to inform you if a new version was released:

<p align="center">
  <img width="595" alt="A version checker says: 'The Lounge v2.7.0 is now available. Read more on GitHub'. There is also a link to release notes of the current version displayed in the UI." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206466-db97c1b4-ff0a-11e7-9a39-4aef6c89e628.png">
</p>

By clicking on the "release notes" link that can be seen above, all the details about the current version appear directly in the client:

<p align="center">
  <img width="589" alt="A Release notes page displays the changelog for the current version." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35206467-dba2ef26-ff0a-11e7-9cd0-f1c813e024e2.png">
</p>

The link previewer now supports WebP images, as well as audio and video links:

<p align="center">
	<img width="537" alt="Big Buck Bunny video on an embedded video player" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35251930-cd33ca7c-ffab-11e7-8ad2-f274c6b2a11b.png">
</p>

Another noticeable change is the new message alignment in the main chat window, in order to improve visual experience and reduce flickering when loading a page:

<p align="center">
  <img width="553" alt="screen shot 2018-01-21 at 23 53 26" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35252040-7a65d6fe-ffac-11e7-91f9-bbcdc0e54d50.png">
</p>

There were other changes on the client: accessibility of the application has been improved, notices and errors are now displayed in the current channel (then sent to the corresponding network window when reloading), and many bug fixes.

The Lounge v2.7.0 finally comes with its first package API, letting packages register stylesheets in the client. It is in its very early stage at the moment and is subject to change in future releases, so use it at your own risk. There will not be an official documentation before the API stabilizes in v3, but for more information, [refer to the corresponding PR](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/1619).

The CLI has also been improved:

- When a password gets changed using the `reset` command, the new password takes effect immediately, it is not necessary to restart the server anymore.
- A new `uninstall` command has been added to remove themes and packages.
- A new `--config`/`-c` option is available to override entries of the configuration file.

⚠️ This version also comes with a few **deprecations**. All deprecated features are still supported in The Lounge v2.7.0 but be removed from The Lounge v3 (the next version). We recommend upgrading to v2.7.0 **before** upgrading to the future v3, as v2.7.0 will warn you about deprecated configurations in the server output. Those deprecations are:

- Support for Node.js v4 is being removed, making Node.js v6 the oldest version we will support.
- The `LOUNGE_HOME` environment variable is getting replaced with `THELOUNGE_HOME`. Use this in lieu of the deprecated `--home` option as well.
- In the unlikely situation that you are relying on the `.lounge_home` file (mainly useful for package maintainers), it is being renamed to `.thelounge_home`.
- The CLI command is being changed from `lounge` to `thelounge`.
- All options for the `start` command are being removed, replaced with the `--config`/`-c` option mentioned above. For example, `--public` becomes `-c public=true`, `--port 9001` becomes `-c port=9001`, etc.
- Referring to themes in the `theme` option of the configuration file is now done through their name, not their CSS file name.


And finally... **The Lounge has its own logo!** 🎉

<p align="center">
  <img width="1239" alt="The Lounge logos on dark and white backgrounds" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/35253668-ae9604aa-ffb4-11e7-8328-3933b6474c42.png">
</p>

A huge thank you to **Francesca Segantini**, the artist who designed it!
We will start rolling out our new logo in all the relevant places as of The Lounge v3. In the meantime, you can find details about the logo (and stickers!) on [the corresponding issue](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/282#issuecomment-360368920).

## v2.5.0 - 2017-10-17

For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.4.0...v2.5.0) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/milestone/22?closed=1).

If you thought the [v2.3.0 release](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/releases/tag/v2.3.0) was big, well, v2.5.0 is even bigger! 🎉

If you are a client user, you will notice that The Lounge is now using your operating system's font, and that status messages (joins, parts, nick changes, etc.) are now condensed with each other.

<p align="center">
  <img width="555" alt="Condensed status messages displaying 3 users have joined the channel, 4 users have quit, and 1 user has changed nick" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/31530599-a6d719f2-afaf-11e7-9b82-db0365c41c4e.png">
  <br>
  <em>Condensed status messages</em>
</p>

After a while, you'll realize that the client now automatically reconnects when losing network connection (farewell, `Client connection lost — Click here to reconnect`!), and that the channel backlog now automatically loads when you scroll up. Unfortunately, that last bit forced us to phase out the `/clear` command for technical reasons.

If you go to the _Settings_ page, you'll notice that The Lounge now supports push notifications (yes, even on mobile, except iOS), and that you can remotely log out open sessions.

<p align="center">
  <img width="477" alt="Session list with the ability to disconnect remote sessions" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/31530598-a6c86b46-afaf-11e7-9272-eb742d328686.png">
  <br>
  <em>Current and remote sessions</em>
</p>

As a server administrator, you might be interested in a few new additions:

- Themes can now be [retrieved from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Athelounge-theme) and installed using a new CLI command `lounge install <theme-name>`
- Integration with LDAP has been completely refactored
- The Lounge can now be bound to Unix sockets

⚠️ Note that `--home` is now deprecated in favor of the `$LOUNGE_HOME` environment variable (or the `.lounge_home` file in the installation directory). Also, if you are running The Lounge behind a proxy (like nginx or Apache), you will need to make sure that `reverseProxy` is set to `true` and the `X-Forwarded-For` header correctly set for session listing to work correctly on the client.

Enjoy! 💬

- All previews on the current channel can now be hidden or displayed using the `/collapse` and `/expand` commands
- Thumbnails can be opened in a fullscreen viewer without leaving the app by clicking on them, and cycled using the previous/next buttons or by hitting <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>
- Say bye to mixed content warnings: The Lounge can now proxy all images (opt-in option in the server settings) for better privacy
- Title and description are improved overall

Also in this release, auto-complete feature now has an opt-out option in the client settings, and emoji can be searched using fuzzy-matching:

Expect a lot of new cool stuff, tons of bug fixes and performance improvements.
Thanks to all 16 contributors (!!) who pitched in for this release, open source at its finest!

On the server side, The Lounge now supports an auto-away mechanism, stores channel keys across restarts and key changes, and supports a new SSL CA bundle option in the configuration file.

Users of the client will notice some changes as well:

- A bunch of new hotkeys to style messages (bold, italic, underline, foreground/background color), all listed in the Help window

- A new autocomplete mechanism for emoji, users, channels, commands, and colors:

  Note that due to the new nick autocomplete, we removed the now unnecessary nick cycle button that was temporarily added in the meantime. Lots of users have reported it had been broken by a previous release anyway.

- Support of page up/down keys to browse the current chat

- Friendliness-bump of time-related tooltips and date marker:

- Improved channel list with `/list`

- Support for `/ban`, `/unban` and `/banlist`

- Fuzzy-matching of the user list search to find folks more easily:

## v2.2.2 - 2017-03-13

For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.2.1...v2.2.2) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/milestone/11?closed=1).

This patch release brings a lot of dependency upgrades and a few fixes. Passing options to the `lounge` CLI (`lounge start --port 8080`, etc.) now works as expected without requiring `--`. We have also disabled ping timeouts for now to hopefully fix automatic reconnection. Finally, upgrading `irc-framework` allows us to fix an extra couple of bugs.

You will now notice a new `(?)` icon at the bottom of the sidebar. It is home of a help center that currently details supported shortcuts and commands. It will be improved over time, but we encourage contributors to help us improve it.

Note that as of this release, `lounge` without any arguments wil display the help information (mirroring `lounge --help`). Prior to this release, it used to start a server, which must now be done explicitly using `lounge start`.

## v2.2.0 - 2017-01-31

For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/milestone/2?closed=1).

Another long-overdue release for The Lounge!

On the client, it is now possible to generate URLs that pre-fill connection inputs in public mode, a date separator makes it into the chats, `/away` and `/back` commands are now supported, idle time gets displayed on `/whois`.<br>
Also, the client does not abruptly refresh when connection is lost anymore, and user search has been slightly improved. Note however that these last 2 items are still not optimal, but improvements are underway!

On the server, more logging! The `debug` option is now an object instead of a boolean, so make sure to update your configuration file accordingly. More details [here](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/v2.2.0/defaults/config.js#L364-L383).<br>
There are changes revolving around user configuration autoloading: it has been greatly improved and therefore it is now enabled by default. Make sure to remove the `autoload` option from your configuration files.

And of course, tons of fixes and less noticeable feature additions and changes, so make sure to check the full list below!

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1)

This is a minor house-keeping release with mostly two sets of changes.

## v2.0.0 - 2016-09-24

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v1.5.0...v2.0.0)

After more than 5 months in the works, v2.0.0 is finally happening, and it's shipping with lots of new and enhanced features! 🎉

First of all, the backend IRC library is completely different, which was the first step to deciding on a major release.
This change brings many improvements and fixes, including support for auto-reconnection! This also allows us to easily improve our [IRCv3 compliance](http://ircv3.net/software/clients.html#web-clients).

Main changes on the server include support for WEBIRC, oidentd and LDAP. On the client, users will notice a lot of improvements about reporting unseen activity (notifications, markers, etc.), support for custom highlights, a new loading page, an auto-expanding message input, a theme selector, and more.

Administrators should note that the channel list format in user configuration files has changed. The old format is deprecated, but it will be automatically converted when the server starts (support may or may not be removed later). Additionally, The Lounge now only runs on Node v4 and up.

The above is only a small subset of changes. A more detailed list can be found below.
The following list features the most noticeable changes only, and more details can be found on all [v2.0.0 pre-releases](https://www.github.com/thelounge/thelounge/releases).

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.0.0-pre.7...v2.0.0-rc.1)

Prior to this release, users of Safari 10 were not able to access The Lounge anymore, because of a conscious change the WebKit made to their support of CSP, as [explained here](https://webkit.org/blog/6830/a-refined-content-security-policy/). This release addresses this issue.

Another notable change is the removal of tooltips on mobiles, as hovering states on mobile devices breaks in different kind of ways. Hopefully there will be a better solution in the future, or better support across mobiles.

This is also the first release candidate for v2.0.0. This means only critical bug fixes will be merged before releasing v2.0.0.

LDAP! That's all there is to be found in this pre-release, but it should please some administrators out there. Big thanks to [@thisisdarshan](https://github.com/thisisdarshan) and [@lindskogen](https://github.com/lindskogen) for sticking with us on this one.

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.0.0-pre.4...v2.0.0-pre.5)

What an exciting release! It's been in the works for more than a month, but the perks are worth the wait.

On the user side, some long-awaited new features can now be found: The Lounge can now track custom highlights, it comes with an auto-expanding text field, and an unread message marker helps keeping track of what happened when you were not watching. A lot of improvements and various bug fixes have been made to the UI.
Note that scrollbar look-and-feel is now delegated to the browser and OS. Use the custom CSS editor and your OS settings to customize them.

Administrators will notice a different format for channels in the user configuration files, and the Docker-related files have been moved to [a dedicated repository](https://github.com/thelounge/docker-lounge). Many bugs have been solved on the server as well.

## v2.0.0-pre.4 - 2016-06-29 [Pre-release]

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v2.0.0-pre.3...v2.0.0-pre.4)

This pre-release adds a loading window, helpful on slow connections.
It also implements token persistency, ensuring users do not have to authenticate at every server restart. As a side effect, security is improved by forcing logging out users on all devices when changing their password.

All generated URLs are now HTTP by default, except when explicitly set to HTTPS. For example, `www.example.com` will link to `http://www.example.com`. One needs to share `https://www.example.com` to point others to a HTTPS location.

As a few users have been having issues when running The Lounge with a non-supported Node.js version, we now detect it early to avoid cryptic errors.

This pre-release also adds minor UI improvements, and fixes from the previous version.
While The Lounge still needs a lot of efforts to be fully accessible, this version slightly improves accessibility on clickable nickname.

Internally, we now keep track of our code coverage, which we do not enforce strictly at the moment.

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/compare/v1.1.1...v1.2.0)

Note that this release will reset client-side settings to their defaults. Current users will have to re-set them in the settings page. This is [a conscious trade-off](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/70#issuecomment-186717859) as the fork is rather new and there are not many settings overall.
