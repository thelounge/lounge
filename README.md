# The Lounge

## FORK NOTES
Do everything as in the lounge documentation and then do the following:

1. Add your .scss files to the **client/css/scss-folder**.
2. *@import* your scss files in **main.scss**
3. *npm run build* (or preferably keep *npm run watch* on!)

See that scss code change your site!

Ps. The hardworking awesome people at The Lounge are working fast so this will be built on the specific codebase that was present the day I needed it... It is not beeing maintained. DS.

The Lounge is the official and community-managed fork of [Shout](https://github.com/erming/shout), by [Mattias Erming](https://github.com/erming).

## Installation and usage

The Lounge requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4 or more recent.

### Running stable releases from npm (recommended)

Run this in a terminal to install (or upgrade) the latest stable release from
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
[sudo] npm install -g thelounge
```

When installation is complete, run:

```sh
lounge start
```

For more information, read the [documentation](https://thelounge.github.io/docs/), [wiki](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/wiki), or run:

```sh
lounge --help
```

### Running from source

The following commands install and run the development version of The Lounge:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thelounge/lounge.git
cd lounge
npm install
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
npm start
```

When installed like this, npm doesn't create a `lounge` executable. Use `npm start -- <command>` to run subcommands.

⚠️ While it is the most recent codebase, this is not production-ready! Run at
your own risk. It is also not recommended to run this as root.

## Development setup

Simply follow the instructions to run The Lounge from source above, on your own
fork.
