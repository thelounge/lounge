# The Lounge

__What is it?__

The Lounge is a web IRC client that you host on your own server.

*This is the official, community-managed fork of @erming's great initiative, the [Shout](https://github.com/erming/shout) project.*

__What features does it have?__

- Multiple user support
- Stays connected even when you close the browser
- Connect from multiple devices at once
- Responsive layout — works well on your smartphone
- _.. and more!_

__Why the fork?__

We felt that the original [Shout](https://github.com/erming/shout) project
"stagnated" a little because its original author wanted it to remain his pet
project (which is a perfectly fine thing!).

A bunch of people, excited about doing things a bit differently than the upstream
project forked it under a new name: “The Lounge”.

This fork aims to be community managed, meaning that the decisions are taken
in a collegial fashion, and that a bunch of maintainers should be able to make
the review process quicker and more streamlined.

## Install

To use The Lounge you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
