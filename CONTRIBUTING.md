### I want to report a bug

- Look at the [open and closed
  issues](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if
  this was not already discussed before. If you can't see any, feel free to
  [open a new issue](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/issues/new).

### I want to contribute to the code

  [issue](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/issues) or on the IRC channel.
